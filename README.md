## Difficulty Levels
Further, there will be 4 levels of difficulty. You must choose to compete in one level, whether individually or as a team, based on your level of confidence in the above areas. Here are some guidelines for the level of skill required for each level:

Each category will have different requirements for each level of expertise.

## Teams
You may do this individually, or in groups of size of 4 or fewer.

## Scoring

Final scoring will be a weighted aggregate of all the categories depending on the level of difficulty chosen.

## Prizes

Each level will have one winner, so there will be 4 winners in total. The prizes themselves will be determined soon.
