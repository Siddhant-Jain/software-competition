# ECE Pulse Software Competition

## Categories

Thanks for taking part in the ECE Pulse 2016 Software Competition! This year, the competition will be broken down in five categories: 
  * Web
  * Security
  * Networking
  * Algorithms
  * Data Structures

## Difficulty Levels

Further, there will be 4 levels of difficulty. You must choose to compete in one level, whether individually or as a team, based on your level of confidence in the above areas. Here are some guidelines for the level of skill required for each level: 
  * Level 1: Taking/Completed ECE 120 or CS 125
  * Level 2: Taking/Completed ECE 220
  * Level 3: Taking/Completed CS 225
  * Level 4: Taking/Completed ECE 391 or CS 241

Each category will have different requirements for each level of expertise.

## Teams

You may do this individually, or in groups of size of 3 or fewer.

Since the categories are very different from each other, you are encouraged to form teams such that your collective skills complement each other and cover as many categories as possible for your skill level.

## Scoring

Final scoring will be a weighted aggregate of all the categories depending on the level of difficulty chosen. Most categories will have an objective rubric, but a few of the challenges will naturally be a little subjective!

## Prizes

Each level will have one winning team, so there will be 4 winning teams in total. The prizes themselves will be announced closer to the competition date.

## Submission

  1. Make a `run.sh` file that compiles and runs your code. For interpreted languages like Python, this will be as simple as running `python <script>.py`. However, for compiled languages like C and Java, this will require your code to compile successfully and immediately run. Each category folder should have a `run.sh` file.
  2. In the root of the folder, make a file called `team.txt` and put the names and NetIDs of all your team members. If you are working individually, put just your name and NetID. 
  3. In the root of the folder, make a file called `level.txt` and put the level you/your team is choosing to compete at.
  4. Zip up all your files into 1 .zip file, and email it `aagandh2@illinois.edu` with the subject `ECE Pulse 2016 Software Competition Submission`.
